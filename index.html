           <ol>
               <p class="text-secondary">Before cloud computing, the following steps were followed in deploying an application:</p><br>
               <li>Create a website.</li><br>
               <li>Deploy it on a physical machine(server) that had an operating system and set up the configurations and middleware needed to run it.</li><br>
               <li>Set up the runtime to run the application, <small class="font-italic">e.g.</small> Apache, Tomcat or IBM Websphere Liberty app server(Java).</li><br>
               <li>Link your app to a database.</li><br>

       <div class="before-cloud">
           <ol>
            <p class="text-secondary">In order to expose your app to your client, one needed all the following:</p><br>
            <li>Set up an IP address and domain name.</li><br>
            <li>Network configurations.</li><br>
            <li>Physical location for your servers.</li><br>
            <li>Electricity for cooling and running your servers.</li><br>
            <li>Security.</li><br>
            <li>A team of experts to install, configure, test, run, secure and update these resources to keep your website running.</li><br>

               <h5 class="text-info">Challenges faced before cloud computing</h5><br>
               <li>Cost - It was costly to build reliable and maintainable software. You likely had to build your own infrastructure that might have been needed to be turned into a data centre which included servers, network equipment, data storage, <small class="font-italic">etc.</small> Then, a team of experts needed to be hired to handle all those resources. All these factors made it difficult for small and mid-size businesses to develop their own software and keep updating it.</li><br>
               <li>Scalability - A high demand for your application by clients meant that you needed to scale up its capacity, which required more resources and some downtime to integrate and upgrade those resources.</li><br>
               <li>Reliability - One required downtime to perform server operations such as maintenance and updates. Some issues that might have caused downtime are power outages, hardware problems, general network issues 
                <small class="font-italic">etc</small> ,which promoted unreliability.</li><br>
               <li>Security - Necessary for all levels: application, network, infrastructure,and physical resources.</li><br>
               <li>Mobility - Part of the team worked onsite to set up the infrastructure and configure the network.</li><br><br>

            <ol>
                <h5 class="text-info">Characteristics of the Cloud</h5><br>
                <p>The cloud makes hardware resources readily available and quick to configure, which shortens the time needed by developers to show a working version of their product. It also allows for reuse of the same resources for successive projects, which is more cost-efficient.</p><br>

                <li>On-demand resources - Have it when you need it with no need for tiresome preparation, downloads and installations.</li><br>
                <li>Self-service - A customer can provision resources themselves by accessing a self-service portal and requesting the resources they want.</li><br>
                <li>Ubiquitous access - Access the cloud from anywhere through internet connection and a  cloud account.</li><br>
                <li>Resource pooling - Pooling hardware resources and abstracting them so that when they're not being used by one customer, they can be used by the next, instead of sitting idle.</li><br>
                <li>Rapid elasticity - Scaling up or down resource consumption is available on demand  with any quantity and at any time.</li><br>
                <li>Measured service - Pay only for what you use, which helps monitor resource wastage.</li><br> 
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="benefits">
            <ol>
                <h5 class="text-info">Benefits of cloud computing</h5><br>

               <li>Cost - Eliminates the capital expense of buying hardware, software and setting up on-site data centers, server racks, IT infrastructure managers <small class="font-italic">etc.</small></li><br>
               <li>Speed - Most cloud computing services are provided on demand, so vast computing resources can be supplied in minutes, giving businesses flexibility and taking pressure off the planning capacity.</li><br>
               <li>Global Scale - Has the ability to scale elastically<small class="font-italic"> i.e. </small>delivering the correct amount of IT resources <small class="font-italic"> e.g. </small>more or less computing power, storage, band-width, when neeeded and from the right geographical location.</li><br>
               <li>Productivity - Enhances productivity of IT teams, as they can focus on achieving more important goals as opposed to setting up hardware at on-site data centers, software patching and other time-consuming IT management tasks.</li><br>
               <li>Reliability - Makes data back-up, disaster recovery and business continuity easier and less expensive since data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites on the cloud provider's network.</li><br>
               <li>Security - Helps protect one's data, apps and infrastructure from potential threats by providing policies, technologies and controls that strengthen security posture.</li><br>
            </ol>

        <div class="factors-for-cc-growth">
            <ol>
                <h5 class="text-info">Factors that have led to the growth of cloud computing
                </h5><br>
                <li>Applications with a short lead time to delivery - Today's apps require a short time to delivery.The need for developers to get their product to the market in the shortest time possible and quickly get feedback, iterate on the idea to make the product better and faster has made the cloud's hardware resources readily available and quick to configure, therefore shortening the time needed by devs to show a working version of their product.</li><br>
                <li>Developers expect to have programming language options and interact with predefined services - Cloud computing provides pre-packaged language support as opposed to the traditional DIY environment.</li><br>
                <li>Modern applications must be able to scale and be managed dynamically - Devs want to be able to add more resources to a specific app (vertical scaling) or add add duplicate instances of the app (horizontal scaling) to handle increased customer load. Cloud platforms provide standardized methods to scale applications.</li><br>
                <li>Developers expect the pay-as-you-go utility computing billing method - This means that they pay for only their cloud usage.</li><br>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="types">
            <ol>
                <h5 class="text-info">Types of Cloud Computing</h5><br>
                <li>Public Cloud - Owned and operated by a 3<sup>rd</sup> party cloud service provider, <small class="font-italic">e.g.</small> Microsoft Azure. All hardware, software and supporting infrastructure is owned and managed by the cloud provider.</li><br>
                <li>Private Cloud - Services and infrastructure are maintained on a private network. Resources are exclusively used by the business. Can be physically located on the company's on-site data center.</li><br>
                <li>Hybrid Cloud - A combination of public and private cloud, bound together by tech that allows data and apps to be shared between them, which in turn gives flexibility, more deployment options and helps optimise existing infrastructure, security and compliance.</li><br>

            </ol>
       </div>

       <div class="cloud-services">
           <ol>
               <h5 class="text-info">Types of Cloud Services/Models</h5><br>
               <p>To build an app, a cloud provider must provide the infrastructure, platform, OS, networking components <small class="font-italic">etc.</small> Using the pizza analogy to explain IaaS, PaaS and SaaS: 
               </p>

               <li>IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) - You order hardware and an infrastructure often managed by you. You deploy only the middleware, runtime and your app. The infrastructure is like pre-made pizza and you bake it to your liking. Therefore, a cloud provider offers clients pay-as-you-go  access to virtual machines, servers storage, networks, operating systems and other computing resources in the cloud. Helps a user avoid the expense and complexity of buying and managing their own data center infrastructure.
               </li><br>

               <li>Paas (Platform as a Service) - More like a pizza getting delivered. The pizza is ready to be eaten and only needs drinks to go with it. The cloud provider offers access to the platform and runtime and you only need to push the application. Therefore, a cloud provider offers access to a cloud-based environment in which the user can build and deliver apps,<small class="font-italic">i.e.</small> supplies and manages the underlying infrastructure.</li><br>

               <li>Saas (Software as a Service) - Using an application hosted at the cloud provider. Similar to going to a restaurant and enjoying your pizza there. Therefore, all underlying infrastructure, middleware, app software and data are located in the service provider's data center. A cloud provider delivers software and applications that are ready to be consumed via the internet, <small class="font-italic">e.g.</small> email, calendar, office tools.
               </li><br>

               <li>Serverless Computing - The cloud provider automatically supplies, scales and manages infrastructure required to run the code, therefore making it easier for a developer to build applications faster. <small class="font-italic">Tip:</small> The term 'serverless' comes from the fact that the management and infrastructure provision tasks are invisible to the developer.</li><br>
               
           </ol>
       </div>

       <div class="cloud-uses">
           <ol>
               <h5 class="text-info">Uses of Cloud Computing</h5><br>
               <li>Create cloud-native apps - Allows for quick building, deployment and scaling of web, mobile applications and API.</li><br>
               <li> Store, back-up and retrieve data - Protects your data by transferring it over the internet to an offsite cloud storage system that's accessible from any location and device.</li><br>
               <li>Stream audio and video - Connect with an audience anywhere at ant time on any device through high-def audio and video with global distribution.
               </li><br>
               <li>Deliver software on demand(Saas) - Lets a user offer the latest software versions and updates to customers, any time they need it and anywhere they are.</li><br>
               <li>Test and build applications - The use of cloud infrastructure that can be easily scaled up or down reduces app development cost and time.</li><br>
               <li>Analyse data - Joins data from across locations and teams in the cloud then uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to get more insights on the data.</li><br>
               <li>Embed intelligence - Use intelligent models that help give valuable insights on the data captured, thereby keeping the audience engaged.
               </li><br>

               <li>HotelsCombined (HQ - Sydney, Australia) - A hotel metasearch engine breaking barriers in the tourism sector. The use of cloud services has enabled them to grow from a tiny start-up to one of the world's largest tourism players with over 25 million customers each month. Clients can book and pay for hotels online, thanks to cloud computing.</li><br>
               <li>Sonnet (Canada) - A Home and Auto Insurance Company. Their use of hybrid cloud computing has helped them manage sensitive customer data. The security infrastructure that provides the ability to effectively manage  risks associated with customer data enhances security thereby keeping their reputation in check and allowing them to focus on their core business, <small class="font-weight-bold">i.e.</small> selling homes and auto insurance.</li><br>
               <li>Fabler Studios (NYC) - A Video Post-Production House. A combination of IaaS and emotion analysis from nVisio (A Creative Digital Firm) helps them create effective videos in less time and at a lower cost, thereby generating more revenue from and for their clients as well as strengthening the connection with audiences.</li><br><br>
