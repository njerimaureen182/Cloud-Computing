           <p class="text-left ml-4">The delivery of on-demand computing services ranging from applications to servers, databases, software, analytics and intelligence over the internet, <small class="font-weight-bold">i.e.</small><br> the cloud, on a pay-as-you-go basis.</p><br>
           <ol>
                <h5 class="text-info">Benefits</h5><br>

               <li>Cost - Eliminates the capital expense of buying hardware, software and setting up on-site data centers, server racks, IT infrastructure managers <small class="font-weight-bold">etc.</small></li><br>
               <li>Speed - Most cloud computing services are provided on demand, so vast vast computing resources can be supplied in minutes, giving businesses flexibility and taking pressure off the planning capacity.</li><br>
               <li>Global Scale - Has the ability to scale elastically<small class="font-weight-bold"> i.e. </small>delivering the correct amount of IT resources <small class="font-weight-bold"> e.g. </small>more or less computing power, storage, band-width, when neeeded and from the right geographical location.</li><br>
               <li>Productivity - Enhances productivity of IT teams, as they can focus on achieving more important goals as opposed to setting up hardware at on-site data centers, software patching and other time-consuming IT management tasks.</li><br>
               <li>Reliability - Makes data back-up, disaster recovery and business continuity easier and less expensive since data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites on the cloud provider's network.</li><br>
               <li>Security - Helps protect one's data, apps and infrastructure from potential threats by providing policies, technologies and controls that strengthen security posture.</li><br>
            </ol>

                <h5 class="text-info">Types of Cloud Computing</h5><br>
                <li>Public Cloud - Owned and operated by a 3<sup>rd</sup> party cloud service provider, <small class="font-weight-bold">e.g.</small> Microsoft Azure. All hardware, software and supporting infrastructure is owned and managed by the cloud provider.</li><br>
                <li>Private Cloud - Services and infrastructure are maintained on a private network. Resources are exclusively used by the business. Can be physically located on the company's on-site data center.</li><br>
                <li>Hybrid Cloud - A combination of public and private cloud, bound together by tech that allows data and apps to be shared between them, which in turn gives flexibility, more deployment options and helps optimise existing infrastructure, security and compliance.public</li><br>

               <h5 class="text-info">Types of Cloud Services/Models</h5><br>
               <li>IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) - One rents IT infrastructure, <small class="font-weight-bold">i.e.</small> virtual machines, servers storage, networks, operating systems from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis. Helps a user avoid the expense and complexity of buying and managing your own data center infrastructure.</li><br>
               <li>Paas (Platform as a Service) - Supports the complete web development lifecycle, <small class="font-weight-bold">i.e.</small> building, testing, deployment, management and updating. Allows a user to develop and deploy cloud-based apps, whether simple or sophisticated in a cloud-enabled environment. </li><br>
               <li>Serverless Computing - The cloud provider automatically supplies, scales and manages infrastructure required to run the code, therefore making it easier for a developer to build applications faster. 
                   <small class="font-weight-bold">Tip:</small> The term 'serverless' comes from the fact that the management and infrastructure provision tasks are invisible to the developer.</li><br>
               <li>Saas (Software as a Service) - Allows a user to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the internet, <small class="font-weight-bold">e.g.</small> email, calendar, office tools. All underlying infrastructure, mmiddleware, app software and data are located in the service provider's data center.</li><br>

           </ol>

       <div class="cloud-uses">
           <ol>
               <h5 class="text-info">Uses of Cloud Computing</h5><br>
               <li>Create cloud-native apps - Allows for quick building, deployment and scaling of web, mobile applications and API.</li><br>
               <li> Store, back-up and retrieve data - Protects your data by transferring it over the internet to an offsite cloud storage system that's accessible from any loaction and device.</li><br>
               <li>Stream audio and video - Connect with an audience anywhere at ant time on any device through high-def audio and video with global distribution.
               </li><br>
               <li>Deliver software on demand(Saas) - Lets a user offer the latest software versions and updates to customers, any time they need it and anywhere they are.</li><br>
               <li>Test and build applications - The use of cloud infrastructure that can be easily scaled up or down reduces app development cost and time.</li><br>
               <li>Analyse data - Joins data from across locations and teams in the cloud then uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to get more insights on the data.</li><br>
               <li>Embed intelligence - Use intelligent models that help give valuable insights on the data captured, thereby keeping the audience engaged. </li>
